        <p>
          Scholarship Finder was created out of frustration with how difficult it is to find relatable scholarships.
          As someone who struggled with endless searches and missed opportunities, I wanted to make it easier for
          students to connect with the scholarships that are truly meant for them. Our mission is simple:
          to help students unlock their potential by making scholarship searching and application tracking
          easy, accessible, and efficient.
        </p>
        <p>
          We believe every student deserves the chance to pursue their academic dreams without financial barriers.
          Whether you're looking for merit-based, need-based, or niche-specific scholarships, our platform
          is designed to match you with the opportunities that best fit your profile. Weâ€™re committed to constantly
          improving our platform and expanding our database to serve you better.

          Hi, I'm Hasnain Mucklai, the founder of Scholarship Finder. As a student who faced countless barriers to securing 
          financial aid, I realized there had to be a better way. My goal is to make it easier for students everywhere 
          to find the scholarships they need to succeed.
